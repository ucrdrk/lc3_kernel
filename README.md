# LC-3 Jupyter Kernel

To start using the LC-3 kernel in Jupyter, open this repository in a Github codespace. Go to [https://github.com/ucrdrk/lc3_kernel](https://github.com/ucrdrk/lc3_kernel). Clock on "Code" and then go to the "Codespaces" tab. Next, click on the button that says, "Create codespace on main". The codespace will the start. Once started, under notebooks click on LC3-Kernel.ipynb to explore the basics of the kernel, or Lab01.ipynb to try a first pass at doing an existing lab in a Jupyter notebook.

## Selecting a Kernel

Once you have opened the notebook, you may need to select a Kernel, if it's your first time running the notebook in a codespace. On the right hand side at the top of the notebook you should see a
an icon. If it says next to it "LC-3", you're good to go. If it says "Select a Kernel" then click on the text. In the command prompt you should see the choice "Jupyter Kernel...", click on it, and then select the "LC-3" Kernel. If you do not see this choice, try restarting the codespace and try again. If you still do not see the LC-3 kernel, email me at allan.knight@ucr.edu.

## Notebooks
- [LC-3 Kernel Basics](./notebooks/LC3-Kernel.ipynb) - Explore the features supported by this kernel. It's based on the LC-3 simulator and assembler from the authors of the book.
- [Lab 01](./notebooks/Lab01.ipynb) - Explore a lab for CS 061 converted to a Jupyter notebook that uses the LC-3 Kernel.
