# LC-3 Jupyter Kernel

To start using the LC-3 kernel in Jupyter, open this repository in a Github codespace. Go to [https://github.com/ucrdrk/lc3_kernel](https://github.com/ucrdrk/lc3_kernel). Clock on "Code" and then go to the "Codespaces" tab. Next, click on the button that says, "Create codespace on main". The codespace will the start. Once started, under notebooks click on LC3-Kernel.ipynb to explore the basics of the kernel, or Lab01.ipynb to try a first pass at doing an existing lab in a Jupyter notebook.

## Notebooks
- [LC-3 Kernel Basics](./notebooks/LC3-Kernel.ipynb) - Explore the features supported by this kernel. It's based on the LC-3 simulator and assembler from the authors of the book.
- [Lab 01](./notebooks/Lab01.ipynb) - Explore a lab for CS 061 converted to a Jupyter notebook that uses the LC-3 Kernel.
