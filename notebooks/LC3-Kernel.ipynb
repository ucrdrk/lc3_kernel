    "# LC-3 Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes and gives exmaple on the LC-3 Kernel for Jupyter Notebooks. The pupose of this kernel is to allow LC-3 programmers, mostly student in CS 061 - Machine Organizationa and Assembly Language Programming in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, to explore the language in a quick and easy to use environment. It also allows students having issues with the official LC-3 Tools to do their work in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LC-3 processor is the basis of the textbook [\"Introduction to Computing Systems: From bits and gates to C/C++ & Beyond\"](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/), 3rd Edition,  by Yale N. Patt and Sanjay J. Patel.\n",

    "In the cells below, you can enter any command that is available in the `simulator` application from the [official tools](https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools) for the textbook mentioned above. The only command not supported is the `quit` command, for obvious reasons.\n",
