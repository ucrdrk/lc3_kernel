    "Today’s lab will get you set up, and cover the basics of how to use the LC3 Assembler/emulator, and have you write a tiny program in LC-3 Assembly language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specs for today’s lab are rather lengthy, as there are a lot of new ideas & activities to cover.\n",
    "But don’t panic - each step is pretty simple, and most future lab specs will be shorter (but harder!)\n",

    "   \n",
    "   You <u>MUST</u> read this <u>BEFORE</u> lab.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In general, for all future labs, you must read the lab specs before attending lab, and make a start coding at least the first exercise before lab: this is even more important now that labs are virtual! \n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This source code is passed to a <u>_compiler_</u>, which ultimately produces a machine language <u>_executable_</u>.\n",

    "; Local Data\t; pseudo-ops for hard-coding data go here\n",
    "\n",
    ".end\t; .end is like the “}” after main() in C++. \n",
    "; It means “no more code or data”\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you haven’t figured it out by now, LC-3 comments are denoted by semi-colons. They can be on a line by themselves or on the same line as actual code (after the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "This source code (often referred to as assembly code) is passed to an <u>_assembler_</u> - a much simpler beast than a compiler, but like a compiler it produces a machine language executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-ops (the keywords that start with a '.' like .end - _see next section for more details_) are like compiler directives, in that they tell the assembler how to set things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2    Basics of LC-3 programming\n",
    "\n",
    "An LC-3 program consists of three basic elements: _instructions_, _pseudo-ops_, and _labels_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labels** are simply “aliases” for memory addresses. These are really, really useful because they relieve the programmer of the responsibility of figuring out which line of code is at which memory address, allowing us to use symbolic names to point to data and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudo-ops** tell the assembler how to set things up before starting to translate the source code into machine language. They are a bit like compiler directives in C++, such as #include.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the pseudo-op `.FILL` tells the assembler to write a hard-coded value into memory (i.e. RAM, or system memory). For example, the two `.FILL` pseudo-ops in Table 1 would write the decimal value 6  into memory at x3005 (aka `DEC6`), and the decimal value 12 into memory at x3006 (aka DEC12) before the program begins execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you just need to label the lines - you don't need to know the actual memory addresses corresponding to those labels (that's the assembler's job!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory address| Label | Pseudo-Op | Hard-coded value |\n",
    "|---------------|-------|-----------|------------------|\n",
    "| x3005         | DEC6\t| .FILL     | #6               |\n",
    "| x3006         | DEC12 | .FILL     | #12              |\n",
    "\n",
    "_Table 1: Labels and Pseudo-ops_\n",
    "\n",
    "(The '#' before the numbers means decimal, i.e base 10; 'x' means hexadecimal, i.e. base 16).\n",
    "Now we can refer to these memory locations (and therefore access the data stored there) using the names `DEC6` and `DEC12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn about another pseudo-op `.STRINGZ` in a moment (in section 3.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**  There are 15 LC-3 instructions, in three distinct categories (see this tutorial for more):\n",
    "- Arithmetic / Logic operations (addition, bitwise AND, bitwise NOT)\n",
    "- Data movement (moving data back & forth between memory and local registers)\n",
    "- Program control (changing the order of execution of code - branches & loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following sections illustrate one or two instructions from each of these categories.** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1     Arithmetic / Logic Operations\n",
    "These instructions are used for manipulating values and doing calculations - Adding two numbers, bitwise ANDing two words together, or taking the bitwise logical NOT of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LC-3 has 8 general purpose, 16-bit local registers (analogous to variables in C++), named R0 through R7, that can be used as temporary storage for performing such operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `ADD` instruction (2's complement integer data type)\n",
    "This instruction adds two numbers, and writes the result to a register. It comes in two flavors:\n",
    "One in which both operands come from local registers; the other in which the first operand comes from a register, while the second is actually embedded in the instruction itself (\"immediate\" mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the immediate mode, the embedded value can only be in the range {-16, +15}.**\n",
    "\n",
    "See the `ADD` tutorial (also on the Canvas Resources page,  “LC3 instruction set”) for more details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2     Data movement\n",
    "Data movement instructions are used when you want to copy a value from a memory location into a local register (“loading”), or copy a value from a register to a memory location (“storing”).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing this a <u>**lot**</u>, since the LC-3 can operate only on values in registers, not in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `LD` instruction (“Load Direct” - probably the most frequently used instruction!)\n",
    "This instruction copies the contents of a specified memory location (identified by a label) into a register. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the `LD` tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `LEA` instruction (“Load Effective Address”)\n",
    "This instruction translates a <u>_label_</u> – the name you give to a memory location – back into the 16-bit <u>_memory address_</u> it stands for, and stores that <u>_address_</u> into the specified register.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>There is no actual data movement here</u> – just the decoding of a label. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the `LEA` tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.3 Program control\n",
    "These instructions are used in control structures such as **BRANCHING**, **LOOPING**, and **SUBROUTINE CALLS** (a simpler version of function calls in higher-level languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a program starts at the first instruction and executes one instruction after another in order until it reaches the end (“sequential execution”). \n",
    "\n",
    "Control instructions allow us to alter the default sequencing in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BR` instruction (“Conditional Branch”) can be used to transfer control to the instruction at a specified label based on a condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**All**</u> the control structures you are familiar with from C++ (if; if-else; if-else if-else; for; while; do-while; switch) can be built using this instruction, sometimes in combination with the `JMP` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can learn how it works, we have to know about the Condition Codes:\n",
    "Three \"flags\" (single-bit registers) are set whenever a value is written into any one of the local registers, indicating whether the value being written is Negative, Zero, or Positive. These flags are called the\n",
    "_N Z P Condition Codes_, and allow us to make decisions based on the last value written to a register - referred to as the last modified register (“LMR”).\n",
    "\n",
    "The decisions are made by the conditional branch instruction BR, which has three possible modifiers: \n",
    "{n, z, p}.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess, the n modifier asks whether the N Condition Code is currently set or not (was the value just written negative?); and likewise for the z and p modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BR` instruction can be modified by any combination of n, z, p. It will cause a branch to the labeled instruction **IF AND ONLY IF** any one of the specified conditions is met. \n",
    "See the BR tutorial  \n",
    "\n",
    "**And now, we can finally get started on the actual lab exercises :)**\n"

    "### 3.4\tExercise 1:  lab1_ex1 - A “real” program\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Hello World is out of the way, we can write a program that actually does some processing: it will multiply a number, which we will store in advance in memory, by six _(How hard can that be, right??!?)_\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also take this opportunity to introduce the style you <u>**MUST**</u> use for all your LC-3 programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "First comes the header, which will always be included in your starter code: obviously, you have to always fill it out with your personal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the line .orig x3000 (you may use upper or lower case for all LC-3 instructions, as you wish).\n",
    "This indicates where in memory the code will reside. The LC3 assembler requires all programs to be loaded at or above x3000: all your programs <u>**must**</u> load the “main” routine to x3000 \n",
    "\n",
    "_(just try something else and see what happens!! On second thoughts – don't!)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The code itself multiplies 6 by 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the LC-3 has no multiply instruction (really!!), the operation has to be carried out by adding 12 into an accumulator 6 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have added 6 into an accumulator 12 times: why would that not be a good idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../assets/multiply.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three lines load hard-coded values from memory into registers R1, R2, and R3 respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R1 is an \"accumulator\" - i.e. at the end, it will hold the result - so we have to initialize it to 0; \n",
    "- R2 holds the multiplicand (the number to be multiplied); and \n",
    "- R3 holds the multiplier - we will use it as a loop counter, to keep track of how many times the loop will execute (i.e. we will create a “counter-controlled” loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure you understand how the BRp instruction controls the loop - this is the foundation of all Assembly Language control structures!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, copying values from memory to register (and vice versa) is rather inefficient. \n",
    "Mostly, we can't avoid it - our fixed data has to be stored in memory.\n",
    "However, there is one special value for which we can do better - 0! \n",
    "There is a much cleaner way to \"zero out\" a register than copying a hard coded 0 from memory to register:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "AND R1, R1, x0    ; R1 <- (R1) AND x0000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does what we call a \"bitwise AND\" of R1 with 0, i.e. it ANDs each of the 16 bits in R1 with the corresponding bit in x0000, and stores the result (x0000) back in R1 - a LOT quicker than reading from memory! \n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the program data is stored in a block separated from the code, following the `HALT` instruction, which ends code execution - this way, the processor does not attempt to \"execute\" the data as though it were code!\n",
    "And note how we use comments to clearly distinguish the two blocks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This time, instead of typing `run`, step through each line of code using the Step Over (▶) button or typing `step over` in the Simulator cell until you reach the HALT instruction. Notice how the value of R1 keeps going up by 12 until it reaches (guess what??) 72. You can observe the values of the registers by typing `regs` in the \"Registers\" cell, or by using the (▶) of that cell. You should do this after every `step over` in the \"Simulator\" cell.\n",
